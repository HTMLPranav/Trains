    <h1>Evolution of Trains</h1>
    <p>Trains evolved from simple horse-drawn carts on wooden tracks to steam-powered locomotives in the early 19th century.<br>
         Early trains, like those powered by Richard Trevithick in 1804, were used for hauling coal and materials. Over time, steam power became dominant, connecting towns and cities across vast distances.<br>
         Eventually, electric and diesel engines were introduced, leading to faster and more efficient train travel.</p>
